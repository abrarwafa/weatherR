### Notes

- The two functions take two arguments, which should be enclosed between double quotation, *city* and *date*. Their default values are *city = "Vancouver"* and *date = Sys.date()* which is today's date. 

- For *city* argument, make sure the entered city is spelled correctly. As for cities that are composed of two or more words, add underscore between each word (e.g. "Los_Angeles").

- On the other hand, *date* argument should be entered in "yyyy-mm-dd" format (e.g. "2014-11-26").

- If you are to use the default date, which is today's date, please mind time zone difference *check the __Reflections__ in [vignette](https://github.com/abrarwafa/weatherR/blob/master/vignettes/overview.md) for more details*.
