#' Is it a good day for hiking?
#'
#' This function tells you if it's a good day for hiking based on Chances of Rain.
#'
#' If you want to check if you can go hiking today or on the next four days
#' in any city around the world based on weather conditions (i.e chances of rain),
#' you don't have to go browse the Forecast news.
#' Instead, You can now ask R directly, without tempting yourself
#' by firing up your web browser.
#'
#' @param city The city you want to go Hiking in.
#' The default value is "Vancouver".
#'
#' @param date The day you want to go Hiking on.
#' The default value is today's date. Please mind time zone difference.
#'
#' @return \code{goHike} returns
#'
#' \code{"It's a lovely day for Hiking! :D"}
#' if chances of rain is less than 20 percent,
#'
#' \code{"It might rain today! You might want to stay home"}
#' if chances of rain is between 20 percent and 60 percent, and
#'
#' \code{"Ops! It's a rainy day, you better stay home :("} otherwise.
#' @keywords misc
#' @note case in \code{city} is ignored.
#'
#' Make sure the entered \code{city} is spelled correctly.
#' As for cities that are composed of two or more words,
#' add underscore between each word (e.g. "Los_Angeles").
#'
#' \code{date} should be today's or one of the next four days' date in "yyyy-mm-dd" format.
